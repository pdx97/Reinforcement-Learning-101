# Reinforcement Learning 101

Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning (RL) 101 repository! This space is dedicated to sharing my journey and experiences with reinforcement learning. Whether you're a beginner just starting out in the world of RL or someone looking to gain hands-on experience, you'll find resources, projects, and insights that I've gathered along my learning path.

## About Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve some goals. The agent learns from the outcomes of its actions, rather than from being taught explicitly, making it closer to the way humans learn.
